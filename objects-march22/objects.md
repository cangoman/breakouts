## What are objects

- Basically anything that is not a primitive or a function in JS is an object
- A 'data structure' (fancy term for collection of data)


## How do we use them
- We can pass them to functions
- We can return them form functions


## Some common methods
- get keys, get values, 
- iteration (we use for...of)


## valid keys, anything can be a value
- keys are strings
- values can be anything: primitive values, arrays, other objects, functions

## Some things to keep in mind
- copying objects is not as straighforward as assigning
- be careful when using assignment with objects

## Some applications

ex. 1.
Write a function that takes a string, and returns the character that is most commonly used in the string.



ex. 2. 
Create a function that takes in two strings as two parameters and returns a boolean that indicates whether or not the first string is an anagram of the second string.
